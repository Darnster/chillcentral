  % Welcome
	* Chill Central stops people from contacting you when you need to switch off - be that from work, family or friends.
	* It is particularly useful if you are an employee and use your own device for work where your employer supports BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), or if you are self employed and don't want to shell out for a second phone for personal use. 
    * The philosophy has been to take advantage of functions that Google has already included in modern Android phones, Phone Groups and Calendars in particular.
	* Chill Central builds on these features allowing simple blocking rules to be created based around your work/life schedules with minimal effort.
	* There are lots of apps out there which offer a wider range of features, but none offer the same level of simplicity as Chill Central.
  % Overview
	* Use the "Manage Rules" screen to configure how you want to block callers, based on three pieces of information:
	* 1. One or more system groups on your phone (e.g. Coworkers, Family or Friends).
	* 2. Choose which calendar (e.g. Work, Google Calendar or a Calendar you subscribe via Google).
	* 3. Finally enter an Event Tag  which is an Event entry in the selected Calendar.
	* If a call or SMS arrives and matches all criteria (i.e. the caller is in a matching group and there is an active Calendar event with the specified Tag) the call and/or SMS will be blocked.
  % Group Behaviour
 	* One or more Groups (Phone groups, Google groups and the "Unknown" group) can be included in a single rule.  
	* However each Group can only appear in exactly one rule.  You will notice that the list of available Groups reduces each time a Group is selected when creating a rule.	
  % Testing Rules
	* The test screen allows active rules to be tested. 
	* This requires the user to enter a number used for testing.  The factory setting for this is 666 but the default value can be changed in the configuration screen.
	* The test will confirm whether a particular user is blocked based on any active rules and provides information about the particular rule which blocked the user.
  % App Configuration
	* This screen allows the user to set a number of options. These include:
	* master on/off
	* whether a notification icon appears if an incoming communication has been blocked
	* removal of blocked calls from the phone call list
	* enabling or disabling device logging (for support requests only), and 
	* changing the default number used for testing call rules.
  % End User Licence Agreement
	* The latest version of the EULA is located at chillcentral.co.uk.  You will be informed via an entry in the ChangeLog which accompanies any update to the App if the terms and conditions are updated.
